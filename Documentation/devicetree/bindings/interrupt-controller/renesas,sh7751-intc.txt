  - #interrupt-cells: has to be <2>: an interrupt index and flags, as defined
    in interrupts.txt in this directory.

Example
-------

 	shintc: interrupt-controller@ffd00000 {
		compatible = "renesas,sh7751-intc";
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		reg = <0xffd00000 14>, <0xfe080000 128>;
	};
